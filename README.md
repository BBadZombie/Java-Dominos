# Java-Dominos
Dominos board game written in Java
NOTE - Much more work has been done before these dates, it's just that I started gitHub a while after this project, so a lot of notes are located within the code itself and not the readMe (lmaoooooo)

Notes for 12.17.22 - 
Need to create a for loop that creates the dominos using the stored information from the dominoSetLoop class
Need to make custom canvas class instead of using the one I ripped lmao

Notes for 12.20.22 - 
REMOVED dominoSetLoop() class, wasn't necessary as at that point domino objects were being created in the drawDomino() class
UPDATED drawDomino() method to now drawAllDominos() where as you may guess it now is capable of drawing all domino objects
ADDED doTheThing() method which just calls for the dominoCreate() and drawAllDominos() methods so I don't have to do it separately
Still need to make my own canvas class...
Just remembered need to make sure all classes start with a capital letter, will do that
